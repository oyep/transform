# Preparation of Competent Cells

Grow yeast cells at 30°C in 10 ml YPD broth until mid-log phase (~5 x 10^6 - 2 x 10^7 cells/ml or OD
600 of 0.8-1.0). The following steps are accomplished at room temperature. 

1. Pellet the cells at 500 x g for 4 minutes and discard the supernatant. 
2. Add 10 ml **EZ 1 solution** to wash the pellet. Repellet the cells and discard the supernatant. 
3. Add 1 ml **EZ 2 solution** to resuspend the pellet.

At this point, the competent cells can be used for transformations directly or stored frozen at or below -70°C for future 
use. It is important to freeze the cells slowly. To accomplish this, either wrap the aliquotted cells in 2-6 layers of paper 
towels or place in a Styrofoam box before placing in the freezer. DO NOT use liquid nitrogen to snap-freeze the cells. 

# Transformation

This part of the procedure is the same for both frozen stored (thawed at room temperature) and freshly prepared competent yeast cells.

1. Mix 50 μl of competent cells with 0.2-1μg DNA (in less than 5μl volume); add 500 μl **EZ 3 solution** and mix thoroughly.
2. Incubate at 30°C for 45 minutes. Mix vigorously by flicking with finger or vortexing (if appropriate for your DNA) 2-3 times during this incubation. 
3. Spread 50-150 μl of the above transformation mixture on an appropriate plate. It is unnecessary to pellet and wash the cells before spreading. 

**Incubate the plates at 30°C for 2-4 days to allow for growth of transformants.**
